## Suggested [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) track for getting started with R 
The following courses will get you started in using R for data handling and analysis.  This list focusses on the tidyverse packages which are intuitive to learn and should produce easily readable code. Numbers in brackets show (course time, cumulative time)

1)	Introduction to R (4hrs, 4hrs)
1)	Importing data in R (Part 1) (just sections 1 and 2. Do 3 and 4 if it ever comes up) (1.5hrs, 5.5hrs)
1)	Introduction to the tidyverse (4hrs, 9.5hrs)
1)	Data manipulation in R with dplyr (4hrs, 13.5hrs)
1)	Working with the RStudio IDE (part 1) (do sections 1 & 2 if they help with using RStudio) (2hrs, 15.5hrs)
At this point you should be able to read various data files into R, subset the data, and make some plots
1)	Joining Data in R with dplyr (4hrs, 19.5hrs)
At this point you should be able to bring different datasets together
1)	Intermediate R (6 hrs, 26.5hrs)
1)	Intermediate R – Practice (4hrs, 30.5hrs)
At this point you should be able to do some programming to handle repeat tasks
1)	Exploratory data analysis in R: Case study (do sections 3 & 4. Can do 1 & 2 if you’d like the practice) (2hrs, 31.5hrs)
1)	Cleaning data in R (4hrs, 35.5hrs)
1)	Importing & Cleaning Data in R: Case Studies (4 hrs, 39.5hrs)
At this point you should be able to reshape data to allow more advanced functions to run

Other courses to be chosen afterwards depending on what your work requires:
-	Data Visualisation with ggplot (parts 1, 2 and 3)
-	Correlation and Regression
-	String Manipulation in R with stingr
-	Working with Data in the Tidyverse
-	Writing functions in R
-	Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse


### Recommendations
-	In parallel to working in the datacamp webpage/app, practice what you have learned on your own machine on a dataset that means something to you.  This should be possible from lesson 2 (Importing data in R) onwards.  Feel free to ask colleagues for advice on a good dataset to practice on. It should be:
o	Not too large
o	In the public domain
o	For the first few stages it should be a clean dataset – recommend a csv file with the first row as headers, and the data in columns below that. Ideally some columns will contain numbers and others will contain text 
-	Early on in your learning, figure out a system for recording what you have learned in a way that you can find it further down the line when you’ve forgotten exactly how to do something.  Refreshing your memory from your own code is often the quickest way of doing this (as long as you can find the code easily!).  If you do this well it will be useful to you for your whole coding career.  Here are 2 suggestions for systems
o	Make a folder called ‘code snippets’.  Make R files for each short job, e.g. ‘reading_csv_files.R’ could contain code for reading a csv file, with comments for any notes you want to make for yourself.
o	Use software such as cacher to save and file code snippets (https://app.cacher.io)
